Google Forms Reponses To Docs
================================

When there are a large number of questions on a Google Form, it becomes very difficult to read the questions on the Google Spreadsheet.
Columns start getting cut off and etc...

This script essentially transposes the data stored on Google Spreadsheets and stores it on a Google Doc instead, which is more legible.


Installation
===================================
Note: This installation is pretty manual since I never bothered to publish this on Google Chrome Store. 

1. Copy the contents of src/app.gs to your clipboard.
2. Launch the Google Spreadsheet you are interested in.
3. Open Tools >> Script Editor.
4. Paste the script contents and save.
5. Refresh the Spreadsheet and your done!
